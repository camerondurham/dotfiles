# README

## Not much but still a README! :)

My dotfiles are mainly for me and it's not exactly usable for someone
else yet. I'm focused on support for C++ in NeoVim (and Rust!).

Also, I use zsh with a nice little customized zsh prompt made with the help
from thoughtbot:

I've included plugins pre-installed so the NeoVim config should be
mostly ready to go. However, a few nice things added are LanguageClient
configurations will enable for some files, otherwise, ALE will kick in.

NeoVim will also set the column over 80 characters to light grey
to encourage more readability while coding. I'm using a minimal
color-scheme (paramount) that happend to be my favorite colors.
